# Repo
Repository for storing my PowerShell scripts and Azure ARM templates for automation and deployment.
Welcome to my GitHub repository! This is the place where I store and share the scripts and Azure Resource Manager (ARM) templates I create as part of my work and learning journey.

About Me
Iâ€™m a passionate system administrator and blogger who enjoys sharing insights about Microsoft 365, Azure, and automation. Through my blog, I write about best practices, troubleshooting tips, and how-to guides to help IT professionals streamline their workflows.

This repository serves as an extension of my blog, allowing me to provide the scripts and templates I reference in my posts. By keeping them here, I aim to:

Make my code easily accessible to readers and the community.
Continuously improve and update the scripts/templates based on feedback.
Foster collaboration with like-minded professionals.
